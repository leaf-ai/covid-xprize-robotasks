# the latest "tasks" git repository, then hand control over to generate_predictions.sh or generate_prescriptions.sh.

# This is split into a separate script to give us flexibility in updating the main scripts.
# This file needs to be deployed *manually* to the sandboxes.

# See https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html for what these do
